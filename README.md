# MATH0001-Project
Individual Project on Mastering NX CAD Software

This project focused on developing proficiency in Siemens PLM Software's NX CAD tool. The objective was to first model all the individual components of a radial engine. Following this, the components were assembled, and a rotation simulation was performed.

The project details can be found in the document MATH0001_projet2024.pdf.
